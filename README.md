# K-State CS Hugo Framework

[![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/russfeld/ksucs-hugo/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/russfeld/ksucs-hugo/actions/workflows/docker-image.yml) 

This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)-based web framework for K-State CS lecture content. It uses a lightly adapted version of the [Hugo Theme Relearn]https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/) theme forked into [this repository](https://github.com/ksu-cs-textbooks/hugo-theme-relearn)

Major added features are the addition of [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) slideshow framework, and the creation of an embeddable version of content pages for use with IFrames in [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/) and other learning management systems.
