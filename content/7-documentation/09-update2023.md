## New Features

A full list of changes to the theme can be found on the [What's New](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/basics/migration/index.html) page and in the [Documentation](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/basics/history/index.html).

Some notable feature updates:

* [New Shortcode - Badge]({{% relref "4-shortcodes/08-defaults/badge" %}})
* [New Shortcode - Icon]({{% relref "4-shortcodes/08-defaults/icon" %}})
* [New Shortcode - Tab]({{% relref "4-shortcodes/08-defaults/tab" %}})
* [Many shortcodes now color and icon configurable](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/basics/migration/index.html#5100-2023-01-25)
* [Supports task lists, definition lists, and footnotes using GHFM](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/basics/migration/index.html#580-2022-12-08)
* [Search updates and a dedicated search page](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/basics/configuration/index.html#activate-search)

* [Absolute links now open in separate browser tab, configurable](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/basics/migration/index.html#590-2022-12-23) (this was previously handled by a custom HTML renderer that is no longer used)

{{% notice warning %}}

Currently the template will sometimes include hidden pages in the menu when using `hugo serve` locally, but this does not affect any deployed versions of the site. To resolve this problem, disable fast rendering using `hugo serve --disableFastRender`.

## Upgrading

To upgrade to the new theme version, do the following:

1. Navigate to the `themes/hugo-theme-relearn` directory
2. Use `git pull` to pull the latest version of the theme
3. Navigate back to the root directory of your site.
4. Commit and push the site. It should see a new version of the `themes/hugo-theme-relearn` submodule.

### Enable Search

To enable the new search features, update the `[outputs]` section of the `config.toml` (and other files like `docker.toml` and `github.toml` if present) to the following:
```toml
[outputs]
  home = ["HTML", "RSS", "PRINT", "JSON", "SEARCH", "SEARCHPAGE"]
  section = ["HTML", "RSS", "PRINT", "TELE", "EMBED"]
  page = ["HTML", "RSS", "PRINT", "TELE", "EMBED"]
```

### Enable Auto Theme Variants

To enable automatically detecting theme variants based on the user's OS preferences, find the `themeVariant` item under `[params]` in the `config.toml` (and other files like `docker.toml` and `github.toml` if present) and replace that line with the following:

```toml
  themeVariant = ["auto", "light-theme", "dark-theme"]
  # The first element is the variant for light mode, the second for dark mode
  themeVariantAuto = ["light-theme", "dark-theme"]
```
