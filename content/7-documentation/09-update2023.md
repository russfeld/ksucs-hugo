A full list of changes to the theme can be found on the [What's New](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/basics/migration/index.html) page and in the [Documentation](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/basics/history/index.html).

Some notable feature updates:

{{% notice warning %}}

Currently the template will sometimes include hidden pages in the menu when using `hugo serve` locally, but this does not affect any deployed versions of the site. To resolve this problem, disable fast rendering using `hugo serve --disableFastRender`.

## Upgrading

To upgrade to the new theme version, do the following:

1. Navigate to the `themes/hugo-theme-relearn` directory
2. Use `git pull` to pull the latest version of the theme
3. Navigate back to the root directory of your site.
4. Commit and push the site. It should see a new version of the `themes/hugo-theme-relearn` submodule.

### Enable Search

To enable the new search features, update the `[outputs]` section of the `config.toml` (and other files like `docker.toml` and `github.toml` if present) to the following:
```toml
[outputs]
  home = ["HTML", "RSS", "PRINT", "SEARCH", "SEARCHPAGE"]
  section = ["HTML", "RSS", "PRINT", "TELE", "EMBED"]
  page = ["HTML", "RSS", "PRINT", "TELE", "EMBED"]
```

### Enable Auto Theme Variants

To enable automatically detecting theme variants based on the user's OS preferences, find the `themeVariant` item under `[params]` in the `config.toml` (and other files like `docker.toml` and `github.toml` if present) and replace that line with the following:

```toml
  themeVariant = ["auto", "light-theme", "dark-theme"]
  # The first element is the variant for light mode, the second for dark mode
  themeVariantAuto = ["light-theme", "dark-theme"]
```

### Deprecated Chapter Features

Many of the previous textbooks use the old method for creating chapters by placing `chapter = true` in the frontmatter. This has been deprecated in favor of using the new `archetype = "chapter"` setting. See the [documentation](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/cont/archetypes/) for details.

Unfortunately, the way that the new archetype system assigns chapter numbers is using the `weight` parameter. Many of our books use non-sequential weights to make it simpler to add pages later. This theme adds support for an `ordinal` value in the frontmatter to allow overriding this value.

To get rid of the deprecation warnings, find all pages that contain `chapter = true` and make the following updates:
1. Replace `chapter = true` with `archetype = "chapter"` in the page's frontmatter
2. Remove the top-level headers. Typically these pages would include an `h1` and `h3` header. These are now generated by the archetype.
3. _OPTIONAL_: Add an `ordinal = "X"` line to the frontmatter, and replace the `X` with the chapter number. 

For example, a chapter with the following content:

```
+++
title = "Basic Content"
weight = 5
chapter = true
pre = "<b>0. </b>"
+++

### Chapter 0

# Basic Content

The Basics of this Template
```

should be updated to match this format:

```
+++
title = "Basic Content"
weight = 5
ordinal = "0"
archetype = "chapter"
pre = "<b>0. </b>"
+++
