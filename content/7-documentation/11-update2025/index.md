In Summer 2025 this theme was updated to match version 8.0.0 of the base [Hugo Relearn Theme](https://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn/releases/tag/8.0.0)

## Updated Hugo Version

The new version of the theme was tested on [Hugo v0.48.1](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) or later. I recommend updating your Hugo installation (either locally or by updating the `devcontainer` configuration and rebuilding).

## New Features

A full list of changes to the theme can be found on the [What's New](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/introduction/releasenotes/index.html) page and in the [Changelog](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/introduction/changelog/index.html).
