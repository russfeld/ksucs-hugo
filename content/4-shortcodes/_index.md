### Chapter 4

# Shortcodes

{{% notice note %}}

Documentation on built-in shortcodes can be found on the [Hugo Relearn Theme Documentation](https://mcshelby.github.io/hugo-theme-relearn/shortcodes/index.html).

There are also many useful shortcodes built directly into [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/)

This page and its children demonstrate ones unique to this theme as well as ones we use often.

### Built-In Shortcodes

These are shortcodes built-in to the theme that are mostly unmodified. They link to the default documentation for each one. Examples for CSS testing can be found on a later page.
